# nostromo
A text-based adventure game, inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 film "Alien."

"You are Ellen Ripley, flight officer and operations engineer aboard the **_NOSTROMO_**, an expedition class commercial towing vehicle. Use your wits, your facility with Unix systems, as well as other arcane bits of knowledge to debug ship systems, navigate, support your crewmates, and, should you be so lucky, survive."

*This is a work in progress... it's not ready for play, just yet.
